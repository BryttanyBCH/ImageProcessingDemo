# Image Processing Functions

These functions are written in C. I used the .cpp extenstion for compatiblity reasons.

## B_Processors:
- RGB / YVU Conversion
- Grayscale
- Histogram Equalize
- Minimum Filter
- Maximum Filter
- Median Filter
- Mean Filter
- Region Growing

## B_DataStructs:
- A simple queue implementation (for the region growing)
